\begin{abstract}

We use normal mode decomposition to obtain phonon properties from quasi-harmonic lattice dynamics calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations in unstrained Lennard-Jones argon superlattices with perfect and mixed interfaces. Debye scaling ($\omega^{-2}$) of phonon lifetimes at low frequencies in both perfect and mixed superlattices and Rayleigh scaling ($\omega^{-4}$) for intermediate frequencies in mixed superlattices is observed. Bulk-like lifetime trends are found in longer-period perfect superlattices. A solution, under the relaxation-time approximation, to the phonon Boltzmann transport equation is used to predict cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivity. We find that using a dispersion relation which includes the secondary periodicity is required to predict thermal conductivity in perfect superlattices. The assumption of perturbative disorder, where Tamura elastic mass defect scattering theory can be applied, is found to be valid for predicting cross-plane thermal conductivities but not in-plane thermal conductivities in mixed superlattices. 

%For short-period mixed superlattices, lifetimes below the Ioffe-Regel limit are observed.

\section{Introduction}

Superlattices are nanostructures built from periodic alternating layers of dissimilar materials. Semiconductor superlattices, where phonons dominate the thermal transport, offer potential benefits in thermoelectric energy conversion applications because of the ability to tune their thermal conductivities by controlling the layer thicknesses (i.e., the secondary periodicity) without significantly affecting the electronic transport.\cite{broido1995effect,balandin2003mechanism,kim2006thermal} The existence of a secondary periodicity suggests that bulk-like phonons will not exist in short-period superlattices. Instead, phonons related to the secondary periodicity, which we will refer to as superlattice phonons, are the vibrational modes of interest. To design a superlattice with a tailored thermal conductivity, a rigorous examination of the interplay between the superlattice period thickness and the interfacial mixing present in any experimental sample, which may disrupt the secondary periodicity, is necessary. This need provides the impetus for an analysis to elucidate the effects of the secondary periodicity and interfacial mixing on the properties of superlattice phonons. 

Thermal transport in superlattices has been studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Previous MD studies used the equilibrium Green-Kubo (GK) \cite {PhysRevB.85.195302,PhysRevB.77.184302} technique or the non-equilibrium \cite{PhysRevB.77.184302,PhysRevB.79.214307,PhysRevB.72.174302,PhysRevB.79.075316} direct method to predict thermal conductivity. Bottom-up studies using the BTE relied upon the validity of bulk phonon properties in each layer\cite{walkauskas:2579,chen:220} and approximations for the specularity and conductance of the internal interfaces.\cite{PhysRevB.57.14958} While these two techniques can predict trends in cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivity versus period length, the effects of the secondary periodicity and interfacial mixing on phonon properties cannot be directly obtained.

The effect of interfacial mixing on the cross-plane thermal conductivity, but not on individual phonon modes, of Si/Ge superlattices modeled using the Stillinger-Weber potential was examined by Landry and McGaughey.\cite{PhysRevB.79.075316} They showed that for perfect Si/Ge superlattices, thermal conductivity decreased with increasing period length before leveling out. For superlattices with interfacial mixing, the thermal conductivity, which was always lower than the corresponding perfect case, increased with period length before leveling out. Savic \textit{et al.} used Monte Carlo integration and lattice dynamics calculations (harmonic and anharmonic) to predict the phonon properties and cross-plane thermal conductivities of perfect Si/Ge superlattices (i.e., inclusion of the secondary periodicity without interfacial mixing) modeled using the Tersoff potential. \cite{savic:073113} Their theoretical thermal conductivities over-predicted experimental measurements. Garg \textit{et al.} used density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and lattice dynamics calculations (harmonic and anharmonic) to examine phonon properties in perfect Si/Ge superlattices (i.e., inclusion of the secondary periodicity without interfacial mixing).\cite{doi:10.1021/nl202186y} Similar to Savic \textit{et al.}, their calculations over-predict experimentally-measured cross-plane thermal conductivities. They attributed this discrepancy to the exclusion of interfacial mass-defect scattering in their calculations, which is expected to be present and important in experimental samples. In a follow-up study, Garg and Chen adopted Tamura elastic mass defect scattering theory \cite{tamura_isotope_1983} to modify the DFPT predicted lifetimes through the Matthiesen rule for Si/Ge superlattices (i.e., inclusion of the secondary periodicity and interfacial mixing).\cite{PhysRevB.87.140302} For short-period superlattices, they found a tenfold decrease in the cross-plane thermal conductivity, consistent with the predictions from Landry and McGaughey.\cite{PhysRevB.79.075316} This same approach was used by Luckyanova \textit{et al.} \cite{Luckyanova16112012} in DFPT-driven calculations on GaAs/AlAs superlattices.

In this paper, we explore the relationship between secondary periodicity, interfacial mixing, and superlattice phonon properties. Molecular dynamics-based normal mode decomposition (NMD) is used to predict the full spectrum of phonon properties in unstrained Lennard-Jones (LJ) superlattices with a mass ratio of three for perfect and mixed interfaces. Molecular dynamics has the advantage over reciprocal space-based lattice dynamics techniques in that disorder can be explicitly included. Furthermore, the trends in superlattice thermal conductivity predicted from MD-based approaches are the same as those obtained from DFT-based calculations.\cite{PhysRevB.79.075316,PhysRevB.72.174302,doi:10.1021/nl202186y,PhysRevB.87.140302,Luckyanova16112012} 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{SEC:modeling}, the superlattice geometry is defined and the NMD algorithm is reviewed. In Section~\ref{SEC:results}, superlattice phonon dispersion, phonon lifetimes, and thermal conductivities predicted from GK, NMD, and Tamura theory are presented. In Section~\ref{SEC:sl_phon}, the results are put in context with the concept of phonon coherence.

\section{Modeling Framework}\label{SEC:modeling}
\subsection{Superlattice structure and interactions}\label{SEC:sl_struc}
%%%
The superlattices are built by placing atoms on a face-centered cubic lattice, with the two species only differentiated by their masses. The atomic interactions are modeled using the LJ potential for argon with an energy scale of $1.67\times10^{-21}$ J, a length scale, $\sigma$, of $3.4\times10^{-10}$ m, a mass scale, $m$, of $6.63\times10^{-26}$ kg, and are cutoff and shifted at a radius of $2.5\sigma$. The lighter species has a mass of $m$ and the heavier species has a mass of $3m$. The temperature of all simulations is 20 K, for which the zero-pressure lattice constant, $a$, is 5.315 $\AA$.\cite{mcgaugheythesis} We present results in  dimensionless LJ units unless otherwise noted. 
%($E^*=E/\epsilon$, $T^*=Tk_B/\epsilon$, $\omega^*=\omega\sqrt{\sigma^2m_a/\epsilon}$, $k^*=km^{0.5}_a\sigma^2/(\epsilon^{0.5}k_B)$)

Each superlattice is identified by its unit cell, which consists of $L/2$ conventional four-atom unit cells of each species. The unit cell therefore contains $4L$ atoms. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:md_domain}(a), one period of a $4\times4$ superlattice has eight monolayers (four of each species). The Brillouin zone is a rectangular prism with boundaries at $2\pi/(La)$ in the cross-plane direction and $2\pi/a$ in the in-plane directions. We consider $2\times2$, $4\times4$, $8\times8$, and $14\times14$ superlattices.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
%%%

Interfacial mixing is introduced to a superlattice by flipping the masses of randomly selected atoms in the monolayers adjacent the interfaces until the desired concentrations are reached.\cite{PhysRevB.79.075316} A $4\times4$ superlattice with 80/20 interfacial mixing (the notation corresponds to the concentration of original/foreign species within the monolayers adjacent to the interface) is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:md_domain}(b).

\subsection{Thermal conductivity prediction}\label{SEC:methods}

As in some previous superlattice studies, \cite{Luckyanova16112012,doi:10.1021/nl202186y,savic:073113,PhysRevB.87.140302} a solution to the phonon BTE under the single mode relaxation time approximation,\cite{ziman_electrons_2001} is used to predict the thermal conductivity, $k$, in the $\alpha$-direction from
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:M:conductivity}
\begin{split}
k_{\mathbf{\alpha}}=&\sum_{\nu,\pmb{\kappa}}^{12L,N} c_{ph}\kv
v^{2}_{g,\mathbf{\alpha}}\kv \tau\kv.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%
Here, $c_{ph}\kv$ is the volumetric specific heat, $v_{g,\mathbf{\alpha}}\kv$ is the component of the group velocity vector in the $\alpha$-direction, and $\tau\kv$ is the lifetime of the phonon mode with wavevector $\pmb{\kappa}$ and polarization branch denoted by $\nu$. The summation is over the total number of polarization branches, $12L$, and the number of unit cells in the simulation, $N$. A quantity of interest for nanostructure design purposes \cite{PhysRevB.87.035437} is the phonon mean free path (MFP), $\Lambda\kv$, defined as the average distance travelled between scattering events, \cite{ziman_electrons_2001}
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:M:phonon_mfp}
\begin{split}
\Lambda\kv &= |\pmb{\mathrm{v}}_{g}\kv | \tau\kv,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%
where $\pmb{\mathrm{v}}_{g}\kv$ is the group velocity vector. To obtain the required inputs for Eqs.~(\ref{EQ:M:conductivity}) and~(\ref{EQ:M:phonon_mfp}), we follow the NMD procedure outlined by McGaughey and Kaviany,\cite{PhysRevB.71.184305} Turney \textit{et al.},\cite {PhysRevB.79.064301} and Larkin \textit{et al.},\cite{jason_inpress} in which atomic velocities obtained from MD simulation are projected onto the normal mode eigenvectors obtained from harmonic lattice dynamics calculations. The mode-dependent specific heat is set to be $k_\mathrm{B}/V$, where  $k_\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $V$ is the volume of the MD domain, because MD simulations are classical and obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. As temperature increases, anharmonicity of the potential energy causes the specific heat to deviate from $k_\mathrm{B}/V$, but the effect is small (less than 3\%) for LJ systems at the studied temperature of 20 K.\cite{PhysRevB.71.184305} 

The unit cells for the perfect superlattices, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:md_domain}(a), are used as inputs to the harmonic lattice dynamics calculations, which are performed using GULP,\cite{GULP} to obtain harmonic frequencies, $\omega_H \kv$, and eigenvectors, $ \pmb{\mathrm{e}} \kv$. The calculations are conducted at the allowed wavevectors, which are specified from
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD:allowdkpt}
\pmb{\kappa} = \sum_{\alpha=1}^3 \pmb{\mathrm{b}}_{\alpha} \frac{n_{\alpha}}{N_{\alpha}}.
\end{equation}
%%%
Here, $\pmb{\mathrm{b}}_\alpha$ are the cubically orthogonal reciprocal lattice vectors and, to ensure that all wavevectors are in the first Brillouin zone, $ -\frac{N_\alpha}{2} < n_\alpha \le \frac {N_\alpha}{2}$, where $n_\alpha$ are integers and $N_\alpha$ are constant even integers corresponding to the number of unit cells in the $\alpha$-direction in the MD domain. Through a convergence study described in Appendix~\ref{app:size effects}, we use $N_x=8$ and $N_y=N_z=6$ ($N_x=10$ was used for the $2\times2$ superlattices). Group velocities are calculated using finite differencing about a given harmonic frequency from \cite{ziman_electrons_2001}
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD:vg}
\begin{split}
\pmb{\mathrm{v}}_{g}\kv=\frac{\partial \omega_H \kv}{\partial \pmb{\kappa}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%

The eigenvectors, from harmonic lattice dynamics, and the atomic velocities, from MD simulations performed using LAMMPS with a time step of 4.285 fs,\cite{LAMMPS} are used as inputs to obtain the trajectory of the time derivative of the normal mode coordinate, $\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}$, at time $t$ from
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD:qdot}
\begin{split}
\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}=&\SUM{0}{}\sqrt{\frac{m_b}{N}}\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt e^*\kvba\EXP{i\pmb{\kappa}\cdot\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%
In Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:qdot}), $\dot{u}_{\alpha}\lbt$ is the component of velocity of atom $b$ in the $l$th unit cell with equilibrium position $\mathbf{r}_0\ab{l}{0}$ in direction $\alpha$ and $e^*\kvba$ denotes the complex conjugate of the $\alpha$-component for atom $b$ of the eigenvector for mode  ~$\kv$. While the harmonic lattice dynamics calculations were performed using the unit cells of perfect superlattices, we use the same set of eigenvectors to obtain $\dot{q}\kvt{}{}{}$ for both perfect and mixed superlattices. The effects of mixing are thus captured through the differences in the atomic velocities between perfect and mixed MD domains. The validity of this assumption for the mixed cases (i.e., projecting onto an approximation of the normal mode) will be assessed in Section~\ref{SEC:results}.

By taking the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation of Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:qdot}), the mode kinetic energy power spectrum is obtained: \cite{dove_introduction_1993-3}
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD:SED}
\begin{split}
T\kvw=&\lim_{\tau_0\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{2\tau_0}\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\tau_0}\dot{q}\kvt\exp(-i\omega t)dt\right|^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%% 
Before evaluating Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:SED}), the MD system is equilibrated by velocity rescaling for $10^5$ timesteps followed by a \textit{NVE} (constant mass, volume, and total energy) ensemble for $2.5 \times10^5$ timesteps. The Fourier transform sampling window, $\tau_0$, was set to depend upon the superlattice system and the mode frequency. The number of timesteps for the Fourier transform sampling window and total simulation time are given in Table~\ref{TB:MD_time}. The lag between velocity samples is $2^5$ time steps, which is sufficient to capture the dynamics of the highest-frequency modes. The power spectrum was averaged over the Fourier transform sampling windows and over the number of independent MD simulations, with the initial atomic velocities sampled from a Gaussian distribution using a random seed (see Table~\ref{TB:MD_time}). Further averaging was conducted by imposing the symmetry of the irreducible Brillouin zone.

%%%

In accordance with anharmonic theory,\cite{maradudin_scattering_1962} the power spectrum given by Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:SED}) can be approximated to be a Lorentzian function, centered at $\omega_A\kv$ [which is shifted from $\omega_H\kv$],  with a full width at half maximum $\Gamma\kv$, of the form 
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:NMD:LOR}
T\kvw \approx C_0\kv\frac{\Gamma\kv/\pi}{[\omega_A\kv-\omega]^2+\Gamma^2\kv},
\end{equation}
%%%
when $\Gamma\kv \ll \omega_H\kv$. The phonon lifetime is\cite {maradudin_scattering_1962}
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:lifetime}
\tau\kv=\frac{1}{2\Gamma\kv}.
\end{equation}
%%%
Fitting Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:LOR}) to Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:SED}) was done by considering points within three orders of magnitude of the maximum value. The initial guess for $\Gamma\kv$ was 0.01 and for $\omega_A\kv$, the frequency at the maximum value of $T\kvw$ was used. 

The GK method, which makes no assumptions about the nature of the vibrational modes responsible for thermal transport, was also used to predict the thermal conductivity for both perfect and mixed superlattices. Landry \textit{et al.} previously applied the GK method to LJ superlattices, finding agreement with predictions from non-equilibrium MD simulations and an application of the Fourier law.\cite{PhysRevB.79.075316}
Ten independent MD simulations were performed for each superlattice. For the $2 \times 2$ and $4 \times 4$ superlattices, the total  simulation length was $10^6$ timesteps with a correlation window of $5\times 10^4$ timesteps.  For the $8 \times 8$ and $14 \times 14$ superlattices, the total  simulation length was $10^6$ timesteps with a correlation window of $10^5$ timesteps. In order to minimize the uncertainty in the GK predictions, the converged value of the thermal conductivity was specified using the first-avalanche method described by Chen \textit{et al.} \cite{Chen20102392}

%To provide additional context between thermal conductivity prediction methods, anharmonic lattice dynamics (ALD) was performed using the unit cells for unmixed systems described in Sec.~\ref{SEC:sl_struc}. Using the third order force constants of the LJ potential and perturbation theory, the phonon lifetimes are extracted and thermal conductivity is estimated using Eq.~(\ref{EQ:M:conductivity}). The details of ALD can be found elsewhere.\cite{PhysRevB.79.064301}

\section{Results}\label{SEC:results}
\subsection{Dispersion and Participation Ratio}

Phonon dispersion curves for the perfect $4\times4$ superlattice are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a)-\ref{fig:dispersion}(c). Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a) corresponds to the $[1 0 0]$ (cross-plane) direction, Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(c) corresponds to the $[0 1 0]$ (in-plane) direction, and Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(b) corresponds to the $[1 1 1]$ direction. Frequency gaps emerge at the Brillouin zone boundaries as a consequence of branch folding.\cite{PhysRevB.38.1427,PhysRevB.60.2627} The flat branches for frequencies greater than 15 in Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a) indicate low cross-plane group velocities. The branches in Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(b) and \ref{fig:dispersion}(c), on the other hand, vary strongly with frequency at most wavevectors. From Eq.~(\ref{EQ:M:conductivity}), we note that differences between in-plane and cross-plane components of group velocity are solely responsible for the directional dependence of the thermal conductivity.  Dispersion curves for other superlattices show similar features, with more branches and decreasing length of the cross-plane dimension of the Brillouin zone as the period length increases (the length of the Brillouin zone in the in-plane remains constant at $2\pi/a$).

%%%
The superlattice density of states, plotted as the solid blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(d), shares the $\omega^2$ dependence at low frequencies with that of the bulk of the heavier species (dotted green line). The high-frequency portion of the superlattice density of states follows similar variations to that of the density of states of the lighter species (dashed yellow line). Spatial localization, which has previously been invoked to explain the period-length dependence of superlattice thermal conductivity, \cite{PhysRevB.61.3091} can be estimated by calculating the participation ratio. The participation ratio, $p\kv$, defined as\cite{PhysRevB.70.235214}
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:P_ratio}
\begin{split}
\frac{1}{p\kv}=\sum_{b,\alpha}e\kvba^4,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%
is a measure of the number of atoms that participate in a given mode. For completely delocalized modes, $1/p\sim 1/(4L)$, and for spatially localized modes, $1/p\sim 1$.\cite{PhysRevB.70.235214} The inverse participation ratios plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(e), where the vertical line corresponds to $1/(4L)$, indicate that there is no spatial localization in the $4\times4$ superlattice. The frequency-dependence of the participation ratio and density of states were not found to vary with superlattice period length.

To further investigate the nature of the superlattice vibrational modes, we adopt a modified version of the participation ratio, that we call the partial inverse participation ratio (PIPR). The PIPR is calculated by splitting the components of the eigenvector into portions corresponding to the light ($m$) and heavy ($3m$) species, renormalizing the resulting vectors of length $6L$, and then applying Eq.~(\ref{EQ:P_ratio}). The PIPR, plotted for perfect superlattices in Fig.~\ref{FIG:ipnum}, can be interpreted as a measure of how much one species participates in a given vibrational mode. For the $2 \times 2$ and $4 \times 4$ superlattices, the light and heavy PIPRs are comparable to each other across the entire frequency spectrum, indicating that both species participate nearly equally in almost all vibrational modes. For the $8 \times 8$ and $14 \times 14$ superlattices, however, the heavier species dominates modes with frequencies less than the maximum frequency of the heavier bulk system ($\omega_{3m,max}=14.3$) while the lighter species dominates modes with frequencies greater than $\omega_{3m,max}$. This observation suggests that as the superlattice period length increases, the vibrational modes may increasingly resemble the modes of the respective bulk systems. %In other words, the modes less than $\omega_{3m,max}$ could be represented by bulk modes of the heavier species, while modes greater than $\omega_{3m,max}$ could be represented by bulk modes of the lighter species.

\subsection{Power Spectra}

The power spectra, Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:SED}), for the nine labeled points in Figs.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a)-\ref{fig:dispersion}(c) are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:sed} for both perfect and mixed (80/20 and 60/40) superlattices. While all peaks appear to be Lorentzian centered about a single frequency, there are minor signatures at other frequencies. For perfect superlattices, the amplitude of these minor signatures are two orders of magnitudes smaller than the main peak; the largest being found for mode A. We attribute these minor secondary signatures to the assumption that the normal modes of the harmonic system are representative of the vibrational modes of the true anharmonic system. In mixed superlattices, the intensity of the minor signatures becomes amplified (notably for modes B, E, and H), an indication of the mutual implications of elastic scattering from point defects (random masses with linear springs) and anharmonicity (ordered masses with non-linear springs) on phonon scattering. \cite{RevModPhys.53.175}  Modes around a frequency of 12 experience the largest disruptions for all dispersion directions. We attribute this result to the large density of states around this frequency [see Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(d)] such that there are many channels available for elastic scattering from point defects.\cite{tamura_isotope_1983} 

Fitting a Lorentzian function [Eq.~(\ref{EQ:NMD:LOR})] to obtain the lifetimes reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:sed} was deemed suitable for the 80/20 systems since the coefficient of determination value \cite{Cowpe20081066} for the most affected modes was 0.9. For completeness, the power spectra of a 60/40 superlattice is included in Fig.~\ref{fig:sed}, in which the peaks for modes B, E and H are further disrupted to a point where the Lorentzian form begins to disappear. This disruption is evidence that perfect superlattice modes are not always good descriptions of modes in the mixed superlattices. Since the same number of modes are present in both perfect and mixed systems, the superlattice phonons that emerge from the secondary periodicity are effectively disrupted as the crystal symmetry is broken by the interfacial mixing. For the remainder of this work, the 80/20 superlattices are used to discuss the effects of interfacial mixing on phonon properties.

\subsection{Lifetimes}

The phonon lifetimes as a function of the harmonic frequencies are plotted in Fig.~\ref{FIG:lifetime}. As the period length increases, we maintain the same number of unit cells, such that the total number of atoms increases. Consequently, the minimum frequency decreases and the longest lifetime increases with increasing period length. Overall, the magnitudes of the lifetimes for a given frequency do not vary significantly from one superlattice to another. The lifetimes for all perfect superlattices exhibit $\omega^{-2}$ scaling at low frequencies. This result is consistent with theoretical predictions for phonon-phonon scattering of modes in the Debye regime, where the density of states scales as $\omega^{2}$ [see Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(d)].\cite{Klemens_Thermal_1951} For the $8\times8$ and $14\times14$ superlattices, the perfect systems have two distinct trends that terminate at the maximum frequencies of the corresponding bulk systems (vertical lines in Fig.~\ref{FIG:lifetime}). The lifetimes in these two regions are comparable to the bulk lifetimes at the corresponding frequencies. This observation is consistent the emergence of bulk-like modes for the longer period superlattices as demonstrated by the PIPRs in Fig.~\ref{FIG:ipnum}.

Under the Debye approximation, a $\omega^{-4}$ lifetime scaling is predicted due to elastic phonon-point defect scattering.\cite{PhysRev.140.A1812,klemens_scattering_1955-3, klemens_thermal_1957-2} As interspecies mixing is introduced to the superlattices, a $\omega^{-4}$ scaling is observed at intermediate frequencies for the $2\times2$ and $4\times4$ superlattices but not for the $8\times8$ and $14\times14$ superlattices. The complicated dispersions of the superlattices, particularly for the $8\times8$ and $14\times14$ structures, where there is a significant amount of branch folding, are not Debye-like at the intermediate frequencies, leading to a deviation from the $\omega^{-4}$ scaling. The lifetimes of low-frequency modes for all mixed superlattices are not affected and follow a similar $\omega^{-2}$ scaling as seen in the perfect superlattices.
%Because the $\tau\kv$ defined by the spectral width in Eq.(\ref{EQ:lifetime}) corresponds to all possibles mechanisms of phonon interaction, the $\omega^{-4}$ scaling diverges at low frequencies and is replaced by a $\omega^{-2}$ scaling. 

The introduction of interfacial mixing broadens the power spectra (Fig.~\ref{fig:sed}) and shifts the phonon lifetimes downward (Fig.~\ref{FIG:lifetime}), particularly at the intermediate and high frequencies. For the $2 \times 2$ and $ 4 \times 4$ mixed superlattices,  the lifetimes of some high-frequency modes fall below the Ioffe-Regel limit, $\tau_\mathrm{IR} =2\pi/\omega$, where a mode has a lifetime equal to its period of oscillation. The normal modes of a perfect superlattice have a plane wave structure. Under the assumption that the normal modes of a perfect superlattice are representative of the mixed superlattice, reaching the Ioffe-Regel limit is therefore not an indication of spatial localization but rather of temporal localization. This statement is supported by the inverse participation ratios which, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(e), are all below the localization limit. Modes that are below the Ioffe-Regel limit can thus be considered to be non-propagating delocalized modes (i.e., diffusons).\cite{allen_thermal_1993,allen1999diffusons} A similar trend in the variation of lifetimes with frequency, dropping below the Ioffe-Regel limit at intermediate frequencies and then rising above at higher frequencies, has also been predicted for LJ alloys.\cite{larkin2013predicting}

\subsubsection{Perfect superlattices}
With reference to Tables~\ref{TB:K_CP} and~\ref{TB:K_IP}, the trends and magnitudes in cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivity predictions from NMD and GK for perfect superlattices are in good agreement. Since the GK method does not require assumptions about the types of modes present in the systems, the GK estimate of thermal conductivity is used as a benchmark for comparison. Justification for the reported uncertainties is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:size effects}. The in-plane thermal conductivity increases with increasing period length, while the cross-plane thermal conductivity first decreases then increases with period length, consistent with previous MD superlattice studies.\cite {PhysRevB.77.184302,PhysRevB.72.174302} The in-plane thermal conductivity is nearly a factor of two larger than cross-plane thermal conductivity for all superlattices because of the larger group velocities across the entire frequency spectrum for the in-plane direction [see Figs.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a) and~\ref{fig:dispersion}(c)].

is presented in Table~\ref{TB:K_CP}. The boundary resistance for a perfect interface, estimated from the non-equilibrium direct method ($R_{int}=1.4\times10^{-8}$ Km$^2$W$^{-1}$), was combined with bulk thermal conductivities, obtained from NMD, of the lighter material ($k_{m}$=1.2 W/m-K) and the heavier material ($k_{3m}$=0.7 W/m-K) through their respective layer thickness, yielding an effective resistance that was inverted to obtain an effective thermal conductivity. The thermal circuit model underestimates the thermal conductivity for all superlattices, indicating that the bulk phonons of the constituent species are not an accurate description of superlattice phonons. The relative difference decreases with increasing period length, however, suggesting that this model may become representative of the nature of thermal transport at large enough period lengths.

%%%
is presented in Table~\ref{TB:K_IP}. The in-plane thermal conductivity predictions are expected to approach this limit as the superlattice period length is increased.

\subsubsection{Mixed superlattices}
From Tables~\ref{TB:K_CP} and~\ref{TB:K_IP}, the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity predictions for the $2\times 2$ and $4\times 4$ mixed superlattices are reduced from their corresponding perfect system and approach the 50/50 alloy limit (0.21 W/m-K from GK using $N_{x,y,z}=6$). The mixed $2\times 2$ superlattice loses much of its anisotropy between the in-plane and cross-plane directions as there is mixing in all the atomic layers. From Table~\ref{TB:K_CP}, the predictions for mixed superlattices from NMD (using perfect eigenvectors) and GK are in good agreement and follow similar trends, with increasing cross-plane thermal conductivity with increasing period length. From Table~\ref{TB:K_IP}, for mixed superlattices, with the exception of  the $2 \times 2$ superlattice, NMD predicts a lower in-plane thermal conductivity than GK.

To shed light on this discrepancy between GK and NMD in-plane predictions and to assess the assumption of using the perfect superlattice eigenvectors for the mixed superlattices, we also use Tamura elastic mass-defect scattering theory to predict their thermal conductivities. \cite{tamura_isotope_1983,PhysRevB.87.140302,Luckyanova16112012} In this approach, the lifetimes predicted for perfect superlattices, $\tau_{perfect}\kv$, are modified using the Matthiesen rule %as done by Luckyanova et al. \cite{Luckyanova16112012} 
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:tau_eff}

\left (\sum_{b} g_2(b) |e^*\kvbap \cdot e\kvba |^2 \right )\right \} .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%
Here, $g_2(b)$ is the coupling term for atom $b$ in the unit cell that defines the strength of the mass disordering
%%%
\begin{equation}\label{EQ:g(b)}
\begin{split}
g_2(b) = \sum_\mu c_{\mu}(b)\left[1-\frac{m_{\mu}(b)}{\overline{m(b)}}\right]^2, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%
where the summation is over the possible species at that atomic position in the unit cell with the concentration $c_\mu(b)$, mass $m_\mu(b)$, and average mass $\overline{m(b)}$. Given that there are two atom types in the superlattice unit cell, the lighter atom can be considered to be a mass defect of the heavier portion of the superlattice, and vice-versa. $g_2(b)$ is zero if atom $b$ is unmixed (i.e., for atoms that do not reside within one monolayer of the interface). The delta function in Eq.~(\ref{EQ:tau_d}) is broadened into a Lorentzian function with width on the order of the frequency level spacing [i.e., $\omega \kv -\omega \kvp \approx 0.1$] imposed by the finite size of the systems.\cite{allen_thermal_1993}

Cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivity predictions from NMD and Tamura theory are in good agreement, thus yielding a comparable discrepancy with the GK predictions for the in-plane thermal conductivity [see Table~\ref{TB:K_IP}]. While the discrepancy manifests in the in-plane direction, the effect occurs at the mode level. This discrepancy is not observed for the cross-plane thermal conductivities because the most disrupted modes (see Figs.~\ref{fig:sed} and~\ref{FIG:lifetime}) exist at intermediate frequencies with a near zero component of group velocity [Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a)]. The in-plane difference between NMD and Tamura theory with GK increases with period length because the number of branches with non-zero components of group velocity increases. The thermal conductivity predictions for the mixed superlattices indicate that the assumption that eigenvectors from perfect superlattices are representative of the corresponding modes in mixed superlattices is not always valid.

\section{Superlattice phonons}\label{SEC:sl_phon}

The term ``coherence" has been used in two contexts in relation to phonons. First, to describe the modes that emerge from a secondary periodicity (i.e., in a superlattice or a thin film with a periodic arrangement of holes\cite{doi:10.1021/nl102918q,PhysRevB.87.195301}). The second context is used to describe the excitation of long-wavelength phonons, usually by femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe techniques,\cite{PhysRevLett.73.740,PhysRevB.75.195309} that do not carry significant thermal energy and are not found in the MD simulations studied here. While both contexts imply the wave picture of vibrational modes, the former context and its relation to thermal transport is the focus of this section.

In a crystalline solid, the phonons that carry thermal energy belong to the dispersion relation of that material, which depends on the geometry, the harmonic force constants, and the constituent masses. The introduction of a secondary periodicity modifies the dispersion such that modes emerge that do not exist in the composing bulk materials. These non-bulk phonons (in our case, superlattice phonons) propagate and scatter in the periodic structure in a similar manner to what a bulk phonon experiences in a bulk material. By introducing mixing at the interfaces, we observed in Section~\ref{SEC:results} the effect of disrupting the secondary periodicity on the vibrational structure of superlattice phonons. %Coherent effects, for that matter, are found in bulk systems since coherence requires the constructive or destructive interference of waves.

%of vibrational modes when a secondary periodicity is added to a system ( superlattices or a silicon thing file with periodic arrangement of holes),
%The reasons are twofold for the ambiguity attached to the terms \textit {coherent phonon}: its association with exotic configurations of material, like porous silicon \cite{doi:10.1021/nl102918q} where the secondary periodicity emerges from the introduction of the repeated holes or between nanoparticles in a nanofluidic system \cite{Keblinski2002855} and from previous femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe experimental coherent phonon studies \cite{PhysRevLett.73.740,PhysRevB.75.195309} that do not focus upon thermal transport. Coherent effects, for that matter, are found in bulk systems since coherence requires the constructive or destructive interference of waves.

Past literature has cited the superlattice as a structure where coherent effects on thermal transport are possible. The trend in cross-plane thermal conductivity as a function of period length justifies such a claim,\cite{PhysRevB.67.195311,PhysRevB.72.174302,PhysRevB.61.3091} where it is theorized that the minimum thermal conductivity corresponds to the transition from wave-governed transport to particle-governed transport.\cite{PhysRevLett.84.927,PhysRevB.56.10754} %Here, we have observed a minimum in perfect superlattices simply by adopting the correct phonon dispersion for our analysis. 
By using MD simulations, we do not impose any restrictions on the phonon dynamics. The system is allowed to move through its phase space naturally and thus all classical effects, including coherence, should be captured. The results presented in this work indicate that using the superlattice normal modes captures the physics of thermal transport in a perfect superlattice, indicating the importance of using the correct dispersion relation. One cannot use the bulk material phonon properties to predict thermal transport in these non-bulk-like systems. This effect is clearly present for all the systems studied here as evidenced by the discrepancy between the bulk-based thermal circuit model and the NMD and GK predictions (see Tables~\ref{TB:K_CP} and~\ref{TB:K_IP}).

Coherence length, which is defined as the distance a plane wave travels until its phase becomes uncorrelated, only applies to the wave picture of phonon transport. Although there does not appear to be a formal equation for phonon coherence length,\cite{chen2005nanoscale} adopting a unit cell that spans a single superlattice period to generate the modified dispersion relation allows one to ignore the difference between the MFP and coherence length.\cite{PhysRevB.67.195311} This definition is reasonable because the phonons are not localized to a single layer [as confirmed by the participation ratio, see Fig~\ref{fig:dispersion}(e)] and in the perfect superlattice case, the only inelastic (i.e., phase changing) scattering mechanism is the anharmonicity of the LJ potential. 

As a means to study how superlattice phonons contribute to thermal conductivity, cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivity accumulation functions are shown in Fig.~\ref{FIG:MFP_cuml}. Also plotted are the accumulation functions for the two bulk species. The vertical coordinate of any point on the accumulation function represents the thermal conductivity that comes from phonons with MFP less than the horizontal coordinate of that point.

%%%

In-plane accumulation functions of the perfect and mixed superlattices exhibit asymptotic flattening at longer MFPs. Cross-plane accumulation functions of the perfect and mixed superlattices contain step-like jumps at longer MFPs, a consequence of the the finite resolution of the Brillouin Zone.\cite{esfarjani2011heat} These longer MFPs correspond to the low frequency modes that follow the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling [see Fig.~\ref{FIG:lifetime}] and have a non-zero group velocity component in the cross-plane direction [see Fig.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a)]. The significant contributions from the longer MFPs in the cross-plane direction suggest a mechanism for reducing the cross-plane thermal conductivity through the finite size of thin-film superlattices.\cite{Luckyanova16112012} 

The major contribution (greater than 90\%) to cross-plane thermal conductivity for all superlattices, perfect and mixed, is from modes with MFPs greater than the superlattice period length. Furthermore, 40\% ($2 \times 2 $) to 60\% ($14 \times 14$) of cross-plane and in-plane conductivity is from modes with MFPs greater than the system size in those directions ($N_xLa$ for the cross-plane and $N_ya$ for the in-plane). For the bulk materials, the entire contribution to thermal conductivity comes from modes with MFPs greater than the lattice constant, with 50\% of the contribution from modes with MFPs greater than the system length. In the perfect superlattices, MFPs greater than the period length cannot be interpreted any differently than MFPs greater than the lattice constant of a bulk crystalline structure. Based on the accumulation functions and good agreement with GK thermal conductivity predictions, our results indicate that, for the range of superlattices studied here, perfect superlattice phonons and bulk phonons can be treated in the same theoretical treatment frameworks. In this case, the concept of coherent effects can be argued to be purely interpretational and is not required to model phonon transport in these superlattices. 

Mixing shifts the in-plane thermal conductivity contribution to shorter MFPs for the $2 \times 2 $ and $4 \times 4 $ superlattices. Differences between perfect and mixed accumulations functions for cross-plane thermal conductivity manifest at intermediate and longer MFPs. These differences for the in-plane and cross-plane, however, become increasingly smaller with increasing period length. Furthermore, mixing does not change the range of MFPs. While the perfect and mixed accumulation functions share similar trends, the discrepancy between NMD and GK in-plane thermal conductivity predictions indicates that the mixed modes are fundamentally different than the those of the perfect superlattices. The modes in the mixed superlattices cannot be perfectly described by the modes of perfect superlattices and, therefore, the mixed in-plane accumulation functions are not complete representations.
%There remains the question, however, of whether or not this approach will hold for larger superlattice period lengths.

% MFPs greater than the superlattice period length do not manifest because of phase-preserving reflection from the interfaces.

%This statement is confirmed by observing that MFP contribution distribution, normalized by the superlattice period length, for the lighter (orange) and heavier (green) bulk systems (Fig.~\ref{FIG:MFP_cp}) follows the MFP distribution for the perfect superlattices. We do not find evidence that superlattice phonons experience coherent effects and believe that thermal transport in perfect superlattices is accurately represented by the corresponding dispersion relation.%The dimensional value of the peak MFP in perfect superlattices, for both in-plane and cross-plane, does not vary significantly as a function of period length.

%For short period superlattices ($2\times2$, $4\times4$ and $8\times8$), interfacial mixing shifts the average MFP towards the period length and reduces its respective contribution, indicative of the transition of thermal transport from superlattice phonons to thermal transport from phonons which may or may not map to those belonging to the perfect dispersion. %This trend further supports the fact that superlattice phonons become disrupted by interfacial mixing, thereby diminishing the enhancing effects of the secondary periodicity upon cross-plane thermal conductivity. 
%The assumption of the validity of perfect superlattice eigenvectors captures the downward shift in the MFP distributions and generates a discrepancy between GK and Tamura theory or NMD predictions for in-plane thermal conductivity. These results suggest that roughness and disorder disrupt the dispersion effect. At large enough period lengths ($14\times14$), the effect of interspecies mixing has a negligible effect on phonon MFP, as the corresponding lifetimes are less affected with increasing period length (Fig.~\ref{FIG:lifetime}) because of the decrease in the number of interfaces per unit of volume. \cite{PhysRevB.79.075316}

%Mixing introduces an additional scattering mechanism, modeled in Tamura theory as an elastic mass defect. Elastic scattering implies that the wavevector of the incident phonon does not undergo a change in magnitude but only experiences a change in direction and thus is a phase preserving event. However, the use of the Matthiesen rule effectively masks any distinction between anharmonic scattering and defect scattering by encapsulating the overall effect as inelastic scattering. The assumption of the validity of perfect superlattice eigenvectors captures the downward shift in the MFP distributions but generates a discrepancy between GK and Tamura theory or NMD predictions for in-plane thermal conductivity. These results suggest that roughness and disorder disrupt the dispersion effect.% and non-superlattice phonons, but not necessarily bulk-like phonons, may be more representative.%, consequently destroying coherent effects (inelastic scattering may be more representative).\cite{PhysRevB.67.195311,dames_682} 

%Phase is assumed to be randomized through inelastic phonon-phonon, but not elastic boundary or impurity scattering \cite{chen2005nanoscale}. Furthermore, the inability for NMD and ALD to estimate the in-plane thermal conductivity in mixed superlattices indicates the disruption of the superlattice dispersion. 

%Finally, by relying upon the BTE, any coherent effect is abstracted into the phonon-as-a-particle interpretation.
\section{Summary}

We used NMD to predict phonon properties at 20 K in perfect and mixed LJ superlattices with a mass ratio of three. Differences between in-plane and cross-plane components of group velocity are responsible for the differences between in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivities [Figs.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a)-(c), Tables ~\ref{TB:K_CP} and ~\ref{TB:K_IP}]. By fitting the mode power spectra to Lorentzian lineshapes, we observe a $\omega^{-2}$ lifetime scaling for low-frequency modes in perfect and mixed superlattices in Fig.~\ref{FIG:lifetime}. In longer period-length perfect superlattices ($8 \times 8$ and $14 \times 14$), two distinct lifetime trends that terminate at the heavier and lighter maximum bulk frequencies were attributed to the separation in the participation of these modes in the layers of the superlattice [see Fig.~\ref{FIG:ipnum}]. In mixed superlattices, these trends become smeared and a $\omega^{-4}$ lifetime scaling emerges at intermediate frequencies in the $2 \times 2$ and $4 \times 4$ superlattices, indicating elastic mass point defect scattering of Debye-like phonons. We find that interspecies mixing disrupts the secondary periodicity [see panel B in Fig.~\ref{fig:sed}] and reduces phonon lifetimes, manifesting in a discrepancy between the in-plane thermal conductivity predictions for mixed superlattices from GK with NMD and Tamura theory [see Table~\ref{TB:K_IP}]. The discrepancy is the consequence of the use of eigenvectors from perfect superlattices to describe the modes in mixed superlattices.

This result demonstrates that further effort is required in order to improve our understanding of the effects of mixing on phonon superlattices. A crucial step is obtaining detailed experimental characterization of the quality of these interfaces, which can be used as input into the modeling framework presenters here. Due to the computational cost of DFT-based approaches, MD will continue to be a valuable tool in gaining insight into phonon transport in superlattices. 

%thereby reducing in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity (Table~\ref{TB:K_CP} and Table~\ref{TB:K_IP}). 

%We note that the cross-plane thermal conductivity can be reduced by truncating the contribution from longer MFPs through the finite size effect in thin film superlattices [Fig.~\ref{FIG:MFP_cuml}].

\section{Size effects}\label{app:size effects}
Due to their large unit cells, mode-by-mode studies of superlattices are computationally expensive and accounting for size effects in thermal conductivity prediction is challenging. For example, Broido \textit{et al}. were limited to a maximum period length of $8\times 8$ using an iterative solution to the BTE for Si/Ge.\cite {PhysRevB.70.081310} In other studies, the phonon properties for short period Si/Ge superlattices obtained from DFPT were presumed to hold for larger period superlattices.\cite{Luckyanova16112012, doi:10.1021/nl202186y} Similarly, Savic \textit{et al.} extrapolate the phonon lifetimes of low frequency modes of Si/Ge superlattices from a power law fitted to data obtained from a Monte Carlo integration of the BTE.\cite{savic:073113} 

A comparison of the thermal conductivity predictions for superlattices with different system sizes is presented in Tables~\ref{TB:K_CP_NMDsize} (cross-plane) and~\ref{TB:K_IP_NMDsize} (in-plane). The NMD predictions for both the cross-plane and in-plane thermal conductivities varied by 10\% when increasing $N_x$ from six to eight along the cross-plane and fixing $N_y$ and $N_z$ at six ($N_x$ was set to 10 for the $2\times2$ superlattices to resolve the lifetime scalings). %Unlike the previous mode-by mode studies, the phonon properties of short period superlattices was not extended to large period superlattices. 
Due to the scaling of the NMD algorithm [$O(N_xN_yN_z L)$], further increasing the Brillouin zone resolution ($N_i$) was computationally prohibitive. As a result of these size effects, the reported thermal conductivity predictions from NMD are presumed to carry an uncertainty of 10\%. Uncertainty in the GK prediction was specified by systematically removing one seed before calculating the thermal conductivity.

We note that one approach to estimating size effects in NMD thermal conductivity predicitions is to conduct simulations for a range of system sizes, plot the inverse of thermal conductivity versus the inverse of the system length, fit a line through the data, and then take the vertical axis intercept as the bulk value.\cite{PhysRevB.81.214305}  % where the linear behavior of the dispersion near the gamma point of the Brillouin zone and the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling of the lifetimes allowed for the contribution of these unresolved long-wavelength modes to be estimated. \cite{PhysRevB.81.214305} 
This method was not used in previous superlattice studies \cite{doi:10.1021/nl202186y,savic:073113,Luckyanova16112012} and is not used here. The complicated dispersion [Figs.~\ref{fig:dispersion}(a)-(c)] does not guarantee that this approach is viable and, as such, understanding size effects in superlattices warrants further work.
