============
Some visualization of results:

* [Graphs] (https://github.com/schuberm/superlattice/wiki/Graphs)

The raw data used to generate these plots is available under /rawdata. The organization should improve with time. For now, the prefix in from of p (i.e.: 4p in 4p_life.dat) corresponds to the total number of conventional unit cells in the cross-plane direction. For example, 4p is 2 unit cells of mass 1 and 2 unit cells of mass 3. 

#To Do

=============

* Run GK for larger domains
* Project MFP along cross-plane direction
* Max out accuracy of the Lorentzian fits
* Check for localization of modes
