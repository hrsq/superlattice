============
Some visualization of results:

* [Graphs] (https://github.com/schuberm/superlattice/wiki/Graphs)

The raw data used to generate these plots is available under /rawdata. The organization should improve with time. For now, the prefix in from of p (i.e.: 4p in 4p_life.dat) corresponds to the total number of conventional unit cells in the cross-plane direction. For example, 4p is 2 unit cells of mass 1 and 2 unit cells of mass 3. 

#To Do

=============

* Run GK for larger domains
* Project MFP along cross-plane direction
* Max out accuracy of the Lorentzian fits
* Size effects studies
* Check for localization of modes
* Try different mass ratios
* Try run at 10K (average over seed in NMD, fft=2^19) i
* Acoustic vs. Optical modes contribution to K
* Best way to confirm/compare reduction in group velocities?
* Species diffusion studies
* Any way to do a mode by mode comparison?
* Check Eqn 1. of Chen PRB 2004
